We believe all projects should be fast and agile, this includes,  how the website operates on server and the development cycle. 

This guideline is to be used as a reference for all TSWS employees and or open source community.

Here is a helpful table of contents to help you move around this document swiftly.

# 1.Keep It STATIC

Most if not all of the sites we build are static websites, meaning they have no database or backend. This ensures speed, security, and ease of use. That being said there is a time and a place to use a backend or ‘CMS’ ( content management system ). Here at TSWS we like to keep things stupid simple, therefore we keep shit static.

On a side note, if we or a client decides a backend or CMS needs to be used we will discuss that in ‘Project Documentation’, instead of leaving that here. 

## 1.1 Jekyll

All of our sites run on a static site generator called **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)**. Jekyll must be installed to run our dev environment. Refer to there website for more information.

# 2.Build Tools

A build tool is something used to speed up our dev environment to reduce tasks that are very redundant, like minify code, spinning up a server and compiling SASS.

## 2.1 Gulp
## 2.2 SASS
## 2.3 Autoprefixer
## 2.4 Browser Sync
## 2.5 Minify
